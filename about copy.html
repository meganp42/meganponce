            <h3>My name is Megan Ponce and I am currently a sophomore at the University of San Francisco with plans to graduate Spring of 2025. I am studying Design with a minor in Computer Science. Currently, I am working as a graphic designer at the USF Cultural Centers and Language, Literatures, and Culture Department.  <br> <br> I have always had an interest in the arts and have experience in many different mediums. Starting in high school I started working in digital art and found my passion for illustration. That became my main medium in art class and pushed me to think of art as a career. Later on, I worked as President of my high school yearbook club which spark my love of graphic design. In my sophomore year Iâ€™m still interested in publication design, similar to my design process in the yearbook club, but want to try new things. With my computer science minor, I started to work more with web design and am interested in working more with animations. Even though I gravitate towards print/publication design I still want to find a way to work with different types of design throughout my career.</h3>
