                <br>Koi fish swimming in a yin yang position.
                
                <br><br>I intended to create a tattoo design that was meaningful to me by representing elements that are important in my life. I was inspired by one of the examples in the prompt, The Rock’s tattoo of his zodiac sign, so I picked an idea similar to his. In his design, he used a bull since he was a Taurus and since the Pisces symbol is two fishes I decided to design two koi fishes. I have always been intrigued by koi fishes because of what they represent and their natural beauty. The last component of my design is the yin yang symbol because like the koi fish I love what it represents. Koi fish represent perseverance and strength while yin yang represents balance. Since both koi fishes and yin yang are known as good luck charms having this tattoo is like a forever good luck charm on my body always reminding me to have strength, balance, and perseverance.

                <br><br>I intended to create an illustration depicting heartbreak and sorrow. I wanted to focus on the eyes since they can be seen as the windows to our souls. An important detail of this piece is the broken hearts as the pupils of the eye to show one’s heartbreaking. I was influenced by the old 50s comic book art style since the thick weight of the lines made the image very dramatic. I kept the background white to keep the focus on the contour lines of the illustration. Without color, the details were very important to fill the space and create an interesting composition. The immense detail of the pupils grabs the attention of the viewer and focuses on the subject’s heartbreak at that moment.
