                <br><br>An illustration I made for a school event. Art style inspired by illustrator Sarah Wong piece, Oregon Women. I wanted to show a variety of individuals that stood out from the pastel background. The color palette was inspired by the color of the trans and non-binary flags since the event was a community meetup. To create contrast in the design the individuals are made up of darker muted tones. One of the challenges I ran into was creating contrast in the design but overall I like how the individuals interact with one another.

                <br><br>I intended to create a poster that creates a helpless feeling to show the effects of burnout on an individual especially college students. I wanted an image that captures the feeling of having no motivation to do anything and feeling helpless. When imagining the feeling of helplessness I thought of a person on boating scooping out the water that was causing it to sink since no matter what they do they can’t help but sink. Matching with the blue monochromatic palette that I associate with sorrow I try to capture the feelings I felt when I was close to burnout.

                <br><br>In my proposal, I was inspired by Greek mythology more specifically the goddess Persephone. In her story, she was given her own garden in hell to grow whatever plants she wanted. I liked the concept of a secret garden and thought it worked perfectly with the hidden spot in Kalmanovitz Hall which is why my piece is titled “Persephone’s Garden”. Since I was going with the greek mythology and secret garden idea I picked colors that matched the old greek buildings and plants. Yellow and orange were used to represent the old greek buildings and pink and green were used to represent the flowers. Since I want to create a calming and elegant mood I kept the colors light and had little contrast between them. The only contrast between the four colors is the complementary colors of pink and green. The overall warm tones and tints make the art piece soft and peaceful.

                <br>Animation of a fox stalking and devouring a bunny 
                
                <br><br>An interesting idea that I want to convey in my project was presenting a scary situation as something fun and lighthearted. This determined my art style and color palette for this animation. I keep the art style sketch-like and simple to keep the animation easy to understand similar to the cartoon-like Steven Universe. I decided on cool tones with blues and neutrals for my color palette. Cool tones are associated with calmness which contrasts with the fear and scary situations presented. However, there is a contrast in my animation between the fox and the bunny. The warm tones of the orange fox contrast with the white and blues of the rest of the animation. This emphasizes the fox even though he is in the background. The fox also stands out by staying in the shadows, referencing how dangerous the fox is. Color has been a big role in my animation to show how danger is always near but never obvious.
